# ZIS Explorer

This app allows you to easily visualise the ZIS bundles and installed jobspecs associated with your Zendesk account's integration(s).
You can preview bundle content and upload new ones as well as see job specs statuses and manage them.

### The following information is displayed:

* List of your account's integration.
* For the selected integration, list of all the bundles associated.
* List of all the job spec associated with a bundle.
* Preview of the bundle.
* Preview can content can be copied and preview can be expanded to take more screenspace.
* Upload bundles
* Delete bundles (currently requires a Zis flow and an inbound webhook)
* Install/uninstall jobspecs

Please submit bug reports to [Insert Link](). Pull requests are welcome.
