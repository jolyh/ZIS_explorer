# ZIS Explorer

Development in progress.

This app allows you to easily visualise the ZIS bundles and installed jobspecs associated with your Zendesk account's integration(s).
You can preview bundle content and upload new ones as well as see job specs statuses and manage them.

### The following information is displayed:

* List of your account's integrations.
* Upload bundles and delete bundles (currently requires a ZIS flow and an inbound webhook).
* List and manage your job specs.
* Preview and copy of the bundle.
* List and manage your configurations

Please submit bug reports to [Insert Link](). Pull requests are welcome.
